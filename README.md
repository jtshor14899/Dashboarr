## What is Dashboarr?

Dashboarr is a native mobile app (Android & iOS) that connects directly to your self-hosted *arr stack and media services. No backend server required — the app talks to each service's REST API using your API keys.

> **New here?** The [user guide](https://renzobeux.github.io/Dashboarr/guide.html) walks through a first-time setup, and the [FAQ](https://renzobeux.github.io/Dashboarr/#faq) covers the questions that come up most often.

## Download

### iOS — App Store

Dashboarr is now available on the Apple App Store: [Dashboarr on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dashboarr/id6762170117)

### Android — Play Store

Dashboarr is now available on the Google Play Store: [Dashboarr on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dashboarr.app)

### Android — Direct APK (de-Googled / sideload)

If you're running a de-Googled Android (GrapheneOS, LineageOS, /e/OS, etc.) or just prefer to sideload, the signed APK for every release is attached to the matching tag on the [Releases page](https://github.com/RenzoBeux/Dashboarr/releases/latest).

1. Download `app-release.apk` from the latest release
2. Open it on your device — Android will prompt you to allow installs from your browser/file manager
3. Updates are **manual**: there is no in-app updater for sideloaded installs, so check the Releases page periodically (or watch the repo)

The APK is signed with a different key than the Play Store build, so the two can't update over each other. To switch between them, export your config from Settings, uninstall the current app, install the other one, then import the backup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v9+)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- Android device/emulator or iOS device/simulator

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/renzobeux/dashboarr.git
cd dashboarr

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the dev server
pnpm start
```

Scan the QR code with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on your device, or press `a` for Android emulator / `i` for iOS simulator.

For a native development build, run `pnpm android` / `pnpm ios` (or `pnpm android:dev` / `pnpm ios:dev` for the side-by-side dev variant). `google-services.json` (Firebase Cloud Messaging credentials) is not included in the repo — native builds work without it, but push notifications will be unavailable. Release builds fail without it by design.

### Building for Production

```bash
# Android (EAS Build)
pnpm build:android

# iOS (EAS Build)
pnpm build:ios

# Android local production build — produces both AAB (Play Store) and APK (sideload)
pnpm build:android:prod

# Upload the locally-built APK to the GitHub Release matching package.json version
# (creates the release with auto-generated notes if it doesn't exist yet)
pnpm release:android:apk

# Build + upload in one go
pnpm release:android
```

The `release:*` scripts require the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) to be installed and authenticated against the repo. The APK is read from `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` and uploaded to the tag `v<version>` from `package.json`.

## Backend (Optional — Push Notifications)

Dashboarr works fully without a backend. If you want **real push notifications** delivered to your phone's lock screen — torrent completed, new episodes grabbed, request approved, service offline — you can self-host the lightweight companion backend.

The backend polls your services and ingests their webhooks, then fires Expo pushes to every paired device. It pairs with your phone via QR code (no accounts) and supports multiple instances per service kind.

For setup, configuration, environment variables, webhook URLs, and per-instance push attribution, see the **[backend README](backend/dashboarr-backend/README.md)**.

## Configuration

Full walkthrough: **[Dashboarr user guide](https://renzobeux.github.io/Dashboarr/guide.html)**.

All service configuration is done in the **Settings** tab within the app:

1. Enable the services you use
2. Enter each service's **local URL**, **remote URL**, and **API key**
3. Optionally set your **home WiFi SSID** for automatic local/remote URL switching
4. Reorder dashboard cards by entering edit mode on the dashboard

### Using Dashboarr with Tailscale (or any VPN)

Tailscale works great with Dashboarr. The trick is to address each service by its **Tailscale name or IP** (the `100.x.x.x` address, or a MagicDNS name like `radarr.your-tailnet.ts.net`) instead of its plain LAN IP. Tailscale addresses are reachable from anywhere, so Dashboarr never treats them as offline when you leave your home WiFi.

Pick whichever fits you:

- **Simplest (works everywhere):** turn on **Always use Remote URL**, then put your Tailscale address in the **Remote URL** field (leave Local URL empty). One address that works on WiFi and on cellular, with no home-network setup needed.
- **Fast at home, Tailscale away:**
  1. Set **Local URL** to the plain LAN address (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:7878`)
  2. Set **Remote URL** to the Tailscale address (e.g. `http://100.x.x.x:7878`)
  3. Add your home WiFi under **Settings → Home Networks**, turn on auto-switch, and leave **Always use Remote URL** off

  At home Dashboarr uses the direct LAN URL; away it uses Tailscale.
- **Tell Dashboarr the Remote URL needs the VPN:** in the instance editor, under **Routing and security**, turn on **Remote URL needs a VPN**. While no VPN is connected Dashboarr skips that address instead of probing it: the Integrations hub reads **Waiting for VPN**, the Service Health widget marks the tile with a VPN badge and a neutral dot instead of treating it as broken, no "Service offline" notification fires, and the service screen fails fast instead of waiting out the timeout. Works with both setups above (with **Always use Remote URL** on, the Remote URL is the one in use everywhere).
- **VPN that routes your LAN (WireGuard, OpenVPN, Tailscale subnet router):** if your tunnel makes the plain `192.168.x` addresses reachable from anywhere, you have two options. With **Auto-switch network** off, nothing to configure: Dashboarr always uses the Local URL and, while a VPN is connected, no longer marks private addresses offline. With auto-switch on, also enable **Settings → Treat VPN as home** (the toggle appears once auto-switch is on): while any VPN is connected, Dashboarr behaves as if you were on your home WiFi and uses the local URLs directly. The app can only detect that *a* VPN is up, not which one, so enable this only if your VPN reaches your home network.

> Without a VPN connected, avoid putting a `192.168.x` or `10.x` address in the **Remote URL** slot. Private LAN addresses can't be reached over mobile data, so Dashboarr marks them offline when you're off WiFi (when a VPN is connected it will still try them). If you only reach your server through a Tailscale **subnet router** (so it has no `100.x` address of its own), this VPN handling covers you; alternatively, install Tailscale directly on that server so it gets its own Tailscale address.

## How AI is used

Architecture is built with AI, code is written by AI.

- **Planning:** features and architecture are discussed with Claude in planning sessions until the design is what I want.
- **Implementation:** once the plan is settled, Claude implements it.
- **Review:** every PR is reviewed separately by Claude and Codex. I inspect the findings and decide what to do about them.
- **Testing:** before merging, I smoke test the change on real Android and iPhone devices.

Models used: Fable (High/xHigh) for planning, Opus 5 (xHigh) for implementation, Opus 5 (xHigh) and Sol (High) for code review.

## Roadmap

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for planned features and ideas.
